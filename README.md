## Analysis of Macroeconomic Indicators and Stock Market Forecasting for BRICS Countries

### Overview

This project aims to evaluate the impact of macroeconomic indicators on the stock markets of BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa). The study involves the collection and analysis of data on key economic variables and stock indices, the application of econometric models such as ARIMA and GARCH, and the exploration of both short-term and long-term relationships using Error Correction Models (ECM).

### Objectives

- Data Collection: Gather data on GDP, CPI, Unemployment Rate, Money Supply (M2), Interest Rates, Exchange Rates, Trade Balance, Government Debt, and Stock Indices for BRICS countries.
- Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, normalize the variables, and ensure stationarity where required.
- Correlation Analysis: Conduct correlation analysis to identify the relationships between macroeconomic indicators and stock indices.
- Regression Analysis: Perform multiple linear regression analysis to quantify the impact of economic indicators on stock market performance.
- Forecasting: Utilize ARIMA and GARCH models to forecast future stock index values and volatility.
- ECM Implementation: Apply Error Correction Models to understand both short-term and long-term dynamics between the variables.
